# NasaAPODApi
My new NASA APOD web project is an interactive website that leverages NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to showcase daily images, info, and data from the universe. The project aims to educate and inspire visitors to learn more about space and astronomy through a visually stunning and engaging platform.
